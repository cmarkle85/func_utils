# func_utils
Library of utility functions for functional programming.

## example.py
This script is intended to demonstrate how to use some of the functions in utils.py. If everything goes well, executing from the command line will create a file (tempfile.json) with the following content:
{
  "key1": [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1],
  "key2": [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19],
  "key3": [[0, 10], [1, 11], [0, 12], [1, 13], [0, 14], [1, 15], [0, 16], [1, 17], [0, 18], [1, 19]]
}
